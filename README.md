## Super Dad

### Whyï¼Ÿ
As a new father with a newborn baby, I need to take care of the child every day and record activities such as feeding, defecation, and urination. After reviewing existing apps on the market, I found them overly complicated. Therefore, I decided to develop my own application.


### Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Features
1. Record the baby's feeding, defecation, and urination activities
